## Importing and Preprocessing Data: Our Approach

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
Before importing our data, we manually cleaned it by removing Turkish text and unnecessary information. Then, we used the '*dplyr*' and '*tidyr*' packages to improve our understanding of the data. The relevant code is provided below.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In our project, we are working on three data sets, all of which were sourced from the *Turkish Statistical Institute's* ***TÃ¼rkiye Health Survey*** that was conducted in 2022.

### Dataset 1 : The Percentage of Main Diseases/Health Problems Declared by Individuals in the Last 12 Months by Sex, 2016-2022

This data set showcases the percentage of health problems by sex. Only people over the age of 15 were considered for the study, and Alzheimer was evaluated for individuals in the 65+ age group.

```{r}
library(DT)
dataset_1 <- read_xls("tidydataset1.xls")
datatable(dataset_1)
```

Column 1 corresponds to the diseases, and the following columns are the percentages for Male (Column 2,4,6) and Female (Column 3,5,7) individuals in 2016, 2019 and 2022. If we take a look at the visualization of the data as presented below we can see that low back problems are consistently what causes the most issues, in both men and women. In general, women have declared their health problems more than men for all years that were considered for the study.

### Data Set 2 : The Percentage of Individuals' Status of Alcohol Use by Sex and Age Group, 2016-2022

This data set showcases the percentage of individuals' alcohol consumption status by sex and age group.

*Column 1* indicates the age groups starting from 15 years and going all the way to 75+.

*Column 8* has three different field values:

-   Consumers : Indicates the individual partakes in regular alcohol consumption.

-   Doesn't consume : Means the individual has consumed alcohol before, but not anymore/not regularly.

-   Never consume : Indicates the individual has never consumed alcohol before.

```{r}
dataset_2 <- read_excel("tidydataset2.xls")
datatable(dataset_2)
```

*Columns 2, 4, and 6* represent the Male individuals considered in the study in years 2016, 2019 and 2022 respectively.

*Columns 3,5, and 7* represent the Female individuals in the study in years 2016, 2019 and 2022 respectively.

We can further understand this data by visualizing it via a bar chart, as shown below.

### Data Set 3 : Body mass index distribution of individuals by sex, 2008-2022

This data set showcases the body mass index distribution of male and female individuals, as well as a total for the year of each sub-study. The data here was collected every two years startign from 2008, and ending at 2022.

```{r}
dataset_3 <- read_excel("tidydataset3.xls")
datatable(dataset_3)
```
